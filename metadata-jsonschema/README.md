[![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/ty-ras/data-runtypes/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?flag=metadata-jsonschema)](https://codecov.io/gh/ty-ras/data-runtypes)

This folder contains library which contains types and functionality which supports transforming [`runtypes`](https://github.com/pelotom/runtypes) data validation objects into [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org).
This is particularly useful when doing automatic [OpenAPI Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) `Document` generation using [`@ty-ras/metadata-openapi`](https://github.com/ty-ras/metadata-openapi) library.
